# zenbook-duo-2024-ux8406ma-linux

Features:
* brightness sync (any)
* battery limiter (any)
* touch/pen panels mapping (GNOME-specific, requires GNOME 46 or a backported Mutter patch)
* automatic bottom screen on/off (GNOME-specific)
* automatic rotation (GNOME-specific)

## panel mapping

`duo set-tablet-mapping` will set necessary dconf settings, but for them to work you need a Mutter with a patch from https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/3556 and libwacom with this patch https://github.com/linuxwacom/libwacom/pull/640 . Both are merged upstream, so you can just wait.

## watch screens startup application

On most linux distros you can copy watch-screens.desktop that just needs `/path/to/duo` changed before moving it to `~/.config/autostart` to enable automatic keyboard detection and screen orientation in the background.  Be sure to `chmod +x watch-screens.desktop` then log out and back on.

## bottom screen toggle on GNOME

Install https://github.com/jadahl/gnome-monitor-config. I packaged it for NixOS already, see https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/290444.

Since WLAN button code is used for keyboard attach/detach events first we need to disable it. Open dconf-editor and edit the key /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/rfkill-static and remove XF86WLAN from the list:

You MUST log out and log in again after doing it.

Before the next steps, you may need or want to change the scaling settings or change the config at the top of `duo` based on the version of the duo that you have (1080p vs 3k display models)

After that go to Settings -> Keyboard -> (at the bottom) Keyboard Shortcuts -> View and Customize Shortcuts -> Custom Shortcuts and press +.

* Name: "toggle dualscreen mode" or anything else.
* Command: `/absolute/path/to/this/repo/duo set-displays`.
* Shortcut: press "Set Shortcut..." and attach or detach the keyboard (doesn't matter, it sends the same event).

Press "Add" in the top right corner, close everything and log out and in again. Unlike usual shortcuts, this one doesn't work before logging out.

You also want to add `duo set-displays` to your startup so it'll set your laptop to single or dual screen when you log in.

For manual screen management there are `duo top`, `duo bottom`, `duo both` and `duo toggle` (toggles between top and both) commands.


## automatic rotation

Make sure iio-sensor-proxy is installed, the script relies on `monitor-sensor` command from it. Once it's installed and you followed the steps above for dualscreen setup just run `duo watch-rotation` somewhere at the start of your GNOME session.

## brightness sync

Brightness control requires root permissions. I prefer to have sudo with a password by default, so I use a hack to have a NOPASSWD sudo for /usr/bin/env which allows to execute any command. Line in /etc/sudoers looks like `%wheel  ALL=(ALL:ALL)    NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/env`. On NixOS the relevant part of the config is this:

```
  security.sudo = {
    enable = true;
    extraRules = [{
      commands = [
        {
          command = "/usr/bin/env";
          options = [ "NOPASSWD" ];
        }
      ];
      groups = [ "wheel" ];
    }];
  };
```

Once the sudo setup is done you can either run `duo sync-backlight` to sync it once (you may want to bind it to some hotkey) or you can run `duo watch-backlight` at login and it will keep syncing your brightness from the top display to the bottom one.

For most linux distros there is an included systemd service file: `brightness-sync.service` that just needs `/path/to/duo` changed before moving it to `/etc/systemd/system` to enable brightness sync in the background.

## battery limiter

Requires same sudo setup as for the brightness sync. Most likely you want to run `duo bat-limit` or `duo bat-limit 75` (where 75 is your desired threshold percentage, 80 is used if omited) once at the start of your desktop session.

## Notes concerning usage on Fedora 40

The steps described above work on Fedora 40 with the following specific changes:
Prerequisities:
`sudo dnf install lm_sensors gnome-monitor-config inotofy-tools`
Libwacom files elan-425a.tablet and elan-425b.tablet should be copied to /usr/share/libwacom
For brightness sync to work properly, line 10 of the duo.sh should be modified to `backlight=card1-eDP-2-backlight`
